======================

> Root Jahia app

This project is the root of the jahia micro-frontends.

The app-shell micro-frontends approach allow to:

 - Have Independent deployment between modules
 - Simple, decoupled codebases
 - Share dependencies between projects
 - Have Autonomous team

This app shell rely on React, so if you want to add new modules, new routes it should be written in React.
